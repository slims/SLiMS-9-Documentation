The Stock Take Module is a facility available at SLiMS to assist librarians in carrying out collection inventory activities. This activity aims to re-adjust all collections in the library so that you can find out how many collections are available, the number of collections that are missing, the number of collections that are damaged, and the collections that are being borrowed by library patron.^[testing]

When the inventory process starts, all collections except those that are being borrowed (with the status "On Loan") will be considered lost, then enter the "Current Lost Item" sub-menu until the collection is entered in the exemplary data in the inventory process.
