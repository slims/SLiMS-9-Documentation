Click this sub-menu when we have finished taking inventory. In this sub-menu there is a "Purge Lost Item" option. If we check "Yes", then the duplicate data in the sub-menu "Current Lost Items" will be deleted from the system. When unchecked, duplicate data in the "Current Lost Item" sub-menu will be marked with a "Missing" status.
