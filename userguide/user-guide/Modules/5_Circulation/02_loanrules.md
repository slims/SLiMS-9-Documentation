It is a facility to define specific loan rules based on Member Type, Collection Type, GMD. The rules defined in this facility are the same as when we created a rule in the Member Type sub-menu by filling in the fields:

1. Loan Limit
2. Loan Period
3. Reborrow Limit
4. Fines Each Day
5. Overdue Grace Period

An example of defining Loan Rules:

1. Your library has 3 collection types: Book, Audio Visual, Thesis
2. One of the membership type in your library is: Students. With a total borrowing allowance of 2 collections, namely: 1 for the Thesis collection type and 1 for the Audio Visual collection type
3. For that, of course you must have a membership type "Student" with a total borrowing of 2 collections
4. Then in Loan Rules, which must be defined:
   1. Membership type "Student", loan limit for collection type "Audio Visual" is 1
   2. Membership type "Student", loan limit for collection type "Thesis" is 1

When you are finished defining Loan Rules, click on the "Save" button to save the defined rules.

> PLEASE REMEMBER that this is the additional rules of loan with a spesific purposes. If the loan rules defined in the Membership Type is enough for your institution, you should not add another set of loan rules within this sub-menu.
