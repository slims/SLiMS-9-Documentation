In the Current Loans tab, there are facilities to return and extend the loan.

> Note: After completing the process of borrowing (Loans) and ordering (Reserve) do not forget to click on the "Finish Transaction" button. Without pressing this button, all transaction processes will not be recorded in the system and loan transactions cannot be carried out for the next user.

Since the Senayan3-stable13 version, a transaction note printing feature is available. To activate this feature, the first step that must be done is to activate the Print Circulation Receipt section in the System Configuration sub-menu. See the System module documentation. The proof of circulation print option will appear after clicking on the "Finish Transaction" button.

Starting from the Senayan3-stable11 version, it is possible to manually determine the date of loan and return. That is, the date of borrow and return can be determined not based on the configuration of the rules that have been determined through the Member Type or Loan Rules. For activation, please look at the System Configurations sub-menu in the System menu. Determining the Loan and Due date manually can be done by clicking the date we want to change.
