This menu is used to retrieve member data in the SLiMS database and the result is data in .csv format.

To clearly see the column patterns used in member data in SLiMS, open the .csv file using a spreadsheet application such as MS-Excel or LibreOffice Spreadsheet.

Just like the previous sub-chapters, in this sub-menu when exporting data copies there is also a "Put columns names in the first row" field. When this option is checked (Yes), the name of each column will be displayed in the first row of the exported file, as listed in the database.
