This sub-menu is used to retrieve bibliographic data in the SLiMS application, which can then be included in other SLiMS applications. This process can be understood as data exchange.

The export process will generate a .csv file. The .csv format when we look at the contents, sequentially contains the following data:

1. Title
2. GMD
3. Edition
4. ISBN/ISSN
5. Publisher
6. Publishing Year
7. Collation
8. Series Title
9. Call Number
10. Language
11. Publishing Place
12. Classification
13. Abstract/Notes
14. Cover File Name
15. Attachment File Name
16. Author
17. Subjects
18. Item Code

For example the output of a .csv file, when opened using a text editor:

`*"Corruption and development","Text","","9780714649023","Taylor & Francis Inc.","1998","166 p. : ill. ; 22 cm.","","364.1 Rob c","English","London","364.1/322/091724 21","The articles assembled in this volume offer a fresh approach to analysing the problem of corruption in developing countries and the k means to tackle the phenomenon.","corruption_development.jpg",""," <Robinson,Mark>","<Corruption><Development>","<B00006>"*`

In the export process there are options:

1. Field Separator. Defines the delimiter between fields
2. Field Enclosed with. Defines an opening / closing character
3. Record Separator. Separators between data
4. Number of Records to Export (0 for all records). Amount of exported data
5. Start From Record. The first data to be exported starts from
6. Put columns names in the first row. When this option is checked (Yes), the name of each column will be displayed in the first row of the exported file, as listed in the database

To clearly see the column patterns used in bibliographic data in SLiMS, open the .csv file using a spreadsheet application such as MS-Excel or LibreOffice Spreadsheet.

> Note: As of the 9.2.0 release, this sub-menu includes the feature of bringing up header fields in the export results, so that it will display the fields mentioned above.
