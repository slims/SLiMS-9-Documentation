If you have a MARC file, for example .mrc (if you don't have one, you can download a sample Marc file with a .mrc extension at http://opac.perpusnas.go.id) You can process it by clicking on the "Browse" button. and select the files you want to import. "Number of Record to Import" means how many listings / data will be imported, "0" (zero) means all listings in the file.
