This sub-menu is used to enter data copies into the SLiMS database. If this activity is carried out from one SLiMS database to another, the Item Import is carried out after the Data Import. This means that the copies will adjust the bibliographic data that has been imported first.

Just like the previous sub-chapters, when importing data copies in this sub-menu, there is also a field "The first row is the columns name". This section is related to the previous sub-chapters. If in the first row of the exported file there are column names, as listed in the database, then when importing, check the (Yes) option.
