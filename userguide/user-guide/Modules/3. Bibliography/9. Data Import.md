This sub-menu is used to retrieve bibliographic data from outside SLiMS in csv format (or from the SLiMS database in .csv format).

For data import instructions, the SLiMS Development team has made in detail several conversion manuals for the following applications:

1. Athenaeum
2. CDS/WIN/SIPISIS

The manuals can be downloaded at:

1. Manual migrasi data dari Athenaeum - https://goo.gl/pPUY9B
2. Manual migrasi dari CDS/WIN/SIPISIS - https://goo.gl/D8VLFP

For conversion from Athenaeum, the SLiMS Development team once created an online migration tool which can be accessed on the following page:

Senayan Database Converter 0.1 - https://goo.gl/jD5crE

> Note: The application has been stopped in development for a long time. There could be some things that are irrelevant.

In the import process, there are several options:

1. File To Import. The file to be imported has the extension .csv and is in accordance with the .csv format used by SLiMS
2. Field Separator. Separators between segments used. No need to change
3. Field Enclosed with. The opening / closing character of a segment. It doesn't need to be changed
4. Number of Record to Import (0 for all records). Amount of data to import
5. Start from record. The first data to import, starts at
6. The first row is the columns name. This section is related to the previous sub-chapters. If in the first row of the exported file there is a column name, as listed in the database, then when importing, check the (Yes) option

> As of the 9.2.0 release, this sub-menu includes a feature to ignore the header field in the export result (if any), so that it will display the fields mentioned above.
