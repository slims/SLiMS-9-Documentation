P2P Service is a catalog copy feature created from Senayan 3 Stable 14. The basic concept of this feature is to exchange bibliographic data between SLiMS users. P2P Service makes use of SLiMS's xml facility to share bibliographic collections. To use it, simply click P2P Service, enter a keyword and select the location / url / library that you are looking for. If SLiMS finds the collection it is looking for, it will be displayed.

> Update:
> On the release of SLiMS 9 Bulian with the latest release tag, the MARC SRU service and the Z3950 SRU service can also download cover images, provided the cover image data is available in the captured dataset.

In SLiMS 9 Bulian, copy cataloging using P2P Service is equipped with the ability to download book cover data and attachments (if such data is available).
