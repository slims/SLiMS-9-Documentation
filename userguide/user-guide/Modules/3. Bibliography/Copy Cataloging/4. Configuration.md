2. URI. Is the location of the application page that provides metadata that will be retrieved. Example: http://ciseeng.web.id/slims. The link is the location of the server that provides data for P2P services

   > Note: Currently supported protocols for data copying are http and https protocols.

3. Server Type. Fill in the type of copy cataloging service that your server uses as a reference. Is it the MARC SRU, Z3950, or P2P.

When finished, click on the "Save" button to save the configuration that you have made. The list of servers that you have created will appear when you copy cataloging the Bibliography module.
