The output of the export item from SLiMS is as follows:

`*"B00001","","Reference","INV/B00001","0000-00-00","","","MyLibrary","0000-00- 00","","","1","","500000","Rupiah","0000-00-00","2008-12-26 22:11:10","2008-12-26 22:14:13","Ajax : creating Web pages with asynchronous JavaScript and XML"*`

The output is a reference if you want to enter data exemplars .csv to SLiMS. To clearly see the column patterns used in data copies in SLiMS, open the .csv file using a spreadsheet application such as MS-Excel or LibreOffice Spreadsheet.

Just like the previous sub-chapters, in this sub-menu when exporting data copies there is also a "Put columns names in the first row" field. When this option is checked (Yes), the name of each column will be displayed in the first row of the exported file, as listed in the database.
