In the SLiMS 9 Bulian version, login access to the SLiMS administration page is not displayed as in the previous version. Don't worry though. Login access can be accessed by entering the address as shown below:

Or an easy way without having to remember the address, is to click on the link, for example "Information", which will bring up the address http: //localhost/slims9_bulian/index.php?p=libinfo. Replace the word "libinfo" with the word "login" so it looks like this, http: //localhost/slims9_bulian/index.php?p=login. Then enter to bring up login access.

> #### Tip

After this login access appears, don't forget to bookmark the page. So that it can appear on the bookmark bar in the browser you use. By bookmarking the access, then, if you want to log in, you just click on the bookmark.

Several improvements to the login page were made to make access to the Administration Page even easier.

**Remember me** is a feature to extend login time after login. When this feature is checked during login, the system will ignore the login session.

Meanwhile, **Forgot my password** is used to make it easier for Librarians to recover passwords. When Librarian uses this feature, he will be directed to the password reset page.
