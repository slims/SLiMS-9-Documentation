OPAC is an acronym for Online Public Access Catalog with free translation. Online catalog means a series of information about a product, in this case a book, published using internet media which is packaged in one page or website so that it can be accessed from anywhere, anytime, by anyone.

OPAC is a designation for one of the interfaces used by SLiMS. Another interface is the Administration Pages interface. The Administration Homepage interface will be discussed and will be seen in the next chapter. In this chapter, we will look at the details of the SLiMS OPAC interface.
